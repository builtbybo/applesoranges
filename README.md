## Apples and Oranges Task


# My Approach to Step 1:
--------------------------

'The Supermarket Experience'

1. User adds and submits each item like a to do list
2. Item gets pushed into an array
3. List of 'scanned' items are displayed on screen
4. Array is looped through and filtered for specific items 'apples' or 'oranges'
5. Number of items added is displayed on screen
6. Subtotal tally of cost is displayed at the bottom of screen upon each entry

### Extra features:

- Validation has been added so that only 'apples' and 'oranges' can be added
- Autofocus on load
- On focus, input is cleared for new entry

### Extra notes:

As I developed using a supermarket approach i assumed items would be added one at a time as opposed to a whole list being scanned in at the till
